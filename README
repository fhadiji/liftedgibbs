The Makefile has to be adapted to the local machine, i.e. at least the LIB_DAI 
variable needs to point to the libDAI folder. 

To compile libSTREAM call:
	make all

Prepare PYTHONPATH variable by setting:
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.

To test the build call:
	./src/main/python/compareLiftedSampling.py ./resources/smokers1_3p.fg
